# Insta Sorter

If you're like me you love Instapaper and Pinboard.

If you're also like me you click that read later bookmark on anything remotely interesting.

This leads to some fun, especially if you're lazy. You wind up with a shed load of real articles and other random links.

It gets even more fun if you use Pinboard to suck in links, as it soon becomes equally messy.

This tool aims to connect to your accounts, look for patterns (e.g. Youtube links) and automatically either file them into the right place or remove them. Thus leaving your Instapaper feed shiny and clean.

Aim is to do the similar for pinboard (fiddling tags and removing unread status).

# Status

An idea in my head. Will hack on it.

# Requirements

1. Python

# Usage

Since I want this to be automatic I'm aiming for a cron job.
